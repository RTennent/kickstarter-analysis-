Analysis of outcomes of various Kickstarter campaigns 
---
This project reviews data points to determine the drivers of outcomes for successful and unsuccesful fundraising campaigns for the various types of endeavors important to the client, namely non-musical plays staged in the U.S, and also, potentially, in Great Britian.   

The data suggests that Kickstarter campaigns with target goals under $1000 orbetween $3,500-$4,500 launched in the Spring tend to have greater chances of success.
