Analysis of outcomes of various Kickstarter campaigns 
---
This project reviews data points to determine the drivers of outcomes for successful and unsuccesful fundraising campaigns for the various types of endeavors important to the client, namely non-musical plays staged in the U.S.   

Objective and Approach

•	The goal was to develop insights into what factors influence successful crowdfunding campaigns, particularly for plays.
•	I used Excel to analyze data related to crowdfunding campaigns going back to 2009. 

Conclusions

•	Overall, only 2/3rds of crowdfunding campaigns for plays were successful
•	Small productions, those with goals under $1,000 and those up to $5,000, are most likely to succeed (73% and 72% success rate, respectively).  After that, the success rate drops steadily for increasingly ambitious goals. 
•	This trend reverses for campaigns in the $35,000 - $45,000 range, which have the next best chance of achieving their funding goals (67%), but only modestly above the average. 

Recommendations

•	Louise should set a target of $3,000, which balances the most common value and average goals for successful campaigns and also closely matches their average pledge of $3,168.   The presence of other positive factors related to larger pledgors may warranting increasing the goal further. 
•	June seems to be the best time to launch a campaign
o	  While May and June are the busiest months to start campaigns (21% of full year totals), May’s success rate is only 59% compared to 66% for June.   
o	February ties June for the highest monthly success rate but only accounts for 8% of campaign launches.  This may suggest seasonality effects, e.g. lower competition for funding in February improving campaign outcomes for the month.      

Limitations

•	Sampling Size Error
This data is drawn from 1,067 plays and may not be representative of all plays seeking crowdfunding.   This sample could reflect outcomes different than for plays in aggregate, leading to a different set of conclusions.  Further tests for the probability of significant errors stemming from the sample should be conducted to validate the results. 

•	Equal weighing of Sample Observations
Both the amounts raised through crowdfunding as well as the number and range of available platforms and participants have increased significantly since 2009, the beginning of the data set.  I suggest expanding the data to include more recent results and analyzing the results serially to determine whether they should be weighted differently due to fundamental changes that have occurred in crowdfunding arena over the sample period.  Given the current wider reach and more diverse demographics of crowdfunding investors, the drivers and outcomes for a play’s crowdfunding success or failure may have shifted.
